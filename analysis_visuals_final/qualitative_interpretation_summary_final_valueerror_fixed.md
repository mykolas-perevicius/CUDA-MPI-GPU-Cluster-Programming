## Qualitative Interpretation of Advanced Analysis (after fixes)

Key Insight: Hybrid V4 adds 0 LOC but only N/A× median speed‑up at its max NP – host‑staging dominates.

**Correlation LOC vs runtime** → R = -0.18, p = 0.77 → no significant linear trend.

**Scalability**
* V2.2 ScatterHalo median speed‑up @NP4 = N/A×
* V4 MPI+CUDA median speed‑up @NP4 = N/A× (poor)
