This summary helps us quickly review performance across configurations without reprocessing all log output.

## References and Best Practices

- **AlexNet Architecture:**  
  AlexNet is documented on Wikipedia and in numerous research papers. Its original implementation split computation over two GPUs. Our implementation mimics the data-parallel approach.
  
- **CUDA Optimization Techniques:**  
  Use shared memory for tiling in convolution kernels, fuse elementwise operations (like ReLU) with convolution, and coalesce memory accesses.
  
- **MPI Collectives:**  
  MPI functions like `MPI_Gather` for inference and `MPI_Allreduce` for training are essential. NVIDIA’s NCCL integration with MPI can be used later if available ([Open MPI CUDA-aware FAQ](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building#build-cuda)).
  
- **Benchmarks:**  
  Early experiments on AlexNet have shown strong scaling (e.g., nearly 2× speedup on 2 GPUs under ideal conditions). Adjust expectations based on communication overhead and batch size.
  
- **Project Structure:**  
  Organize code modularly into directories like `src/`, `include/`, and `scripts/`. Reuse common kernels between single-node and multi-node versions. Ensure build scripts are consistent across environments (WSL2 for local development, Fedora 37 for grading).

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Version 3 (Single-Node CUDA-only):**  
   Finalize and optimize the custom CUDA kernels for the forward pass of AlexNet. Validate against synthetic data.
2. **Extend to Version 4 (MPI + CUDA Multi-Node):**  
   Integrate MPI calls to replicate data and gather results. Validate that multi-node runs produce consistent outputs.
3. **Benchmark and Iterate:**  
   Use our extended automation script to test different configurations, analyze logs, and identify bottlenecks.
4. **Future Extensions:**  
   - Implement realistic convolution kernels with tiling and shared memory optimizations.
   - Optionally, add support for training with gradient aggregation using MPI_Allreduce.
   - Explore model parallelism if memory constraints become significant.

By following this plan and leveraging our automation scripts, you’ll be able to monitor performance and correctness at each stage. Our research and references provide a strong foundation to build from, and we'll continue iterating, testing, and optimizing until you have a robust, scalable implementation of AlexNet running on your cluster.
